# Nanocar-Builder Governance

Nanocar-Builder is an open source project that depends on contributions from the community.

## Overview

Formula Nano houses projects related to nano technology.
Our mission on Nanocar-Builder is to create a scientific tool for building and simulating molecular cars.
We value an open, collaborative, and diverse community where anyone can join in
discussions, learn from one another, and contribute to the project. This document describes how
we govern ourselves, how decisions are made, and how someone could engage with the project.
